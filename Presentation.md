# BiasShield: Bias-Aware Loan Approval System

## Website Sections Overview

### 1. Loan Prediction

The Loan Prediction section serves as the primary interface for loan officers and financial analysts to input applicant data and receive approval recommendations. This section:

- Provides a comprehensive form to input applicant information including financial data, personal details, and credit history
- Processes the application through our custom XGBoost model trained with fairness constraints
- Displays the approval decision with a probability score indicating confidence level
- Shows a SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) visualization that transparently reveals which factors most influenced the decision
- Allows loan officers to understand exactly why an application was approved or denied
- Ensures decisions are based on relevant financial factors rather than protected attributes

### 2. Fairness Analysis

The Fairness Analysis section provides a comprehensive overview of the model's fairness metrics across different protected attributes. This section:

- Displays key bias metrics across gender, race, age, and disability status
- Quantifies disparities in approval rates, false positive rates, and false negative rates
- Highlights areas where bias exceeds regulatory thresholds (typically 5-10%)
- Provides visual representations of disparities through charts and graphs
- Enables stakeholders to quickly identify which demographic groups may be experiencing unfair treatment
- Serves as the starting point for deeper bias investigations

### 3. Intersectional Bias Heatmap

The Intersectional Bias Heatmap is an advanced visualization tool that reveals how combinations of protected attributes affect model outcomes. This section:

- Creates interactive heatmaps showing bias across intersecting demographic groups (e.g., "Female + Low Income", "Black + Age < 25")
- Allows users to select different combinations of protected attributes to analyze
- Supports multiple fairness metrics including approval rates, false positive rates, and disparate impact
- Uses color coding to quickly identify problematic areas (red) versus fair treatment (green)
- Reveals hidden biases that may not be apparent when examining single attributes in isolation
- Provides insights into how multiple disadvantaged statuses can compound discrimination

### 4. Fairness Remediation Panel

The Fairness Remediation Panel enables users to simulate different bias mitigation strategies and see their impact in real-time. This section:

- Offers multiple remediation strategies including threshold optimization, reweighing, and adversarial debiasing
- Provides an adjustable "remediation strength" slider to control the trade-off between fairness and accuracy
- Shows side-by-side comparisons of original versus remediated metrics
- Calculates improvement percentages for each fairness metric
- Generates actionable recommendations based on the specific bias patterns detected
- Allows users to apply and undo mitigation strategies to understand their effects
- Helps decision-makers select the optimal approach for their specific fairness goals

### 5. Temporal Bias Tracking

The Temporal Bias Tracking section monitors how fairness metrics change over time, helping identify if a model gets more biased as it learns from new data. This section:

- Displays time-series charts of key fairness metrics across different protected attributes
- Allows filtering by time periods (month, quarter, year, all time)
- Shows trend lines to identify patterns in bias metrics over time
- Enables early detection of worsening bias before it becomes a significant issue
- Helps evaluate the effectiveness of bias mitigation strategies over time
- Provides crucial documentation for regulatory compliance and model governance
- Supports data-driven decisions about when to retrain models

### 6. Regulatory Compliance

The Regulatory Compliance section evaluates the model against key lending regulations and provides actionable insights for compliance. This section:

- Assesses compliance with major regulations including ECOA, FHA, and FCRA
- Breaks down compliance scores for specific requirements within each regulation
- Identifies areas needing attention with clear status indicators
- Provides specific recommendations to address compliance gaps
- Displays comparative compliance scores across different regulations
- Helps organizations demonstrate due diligence in fair lending practices
- Reduces regulatory risk by proactively identifying and addressing issues

### 7. Bias Remediation

The Bias Remediation section provides strategic recommendations for addressing identified bias issues at both technical and organizational levels. This section:

- Offers concrete strategies to mitigate bias based on the specific patterns detected
- Provides technical recommendations for model adjustments and data improvements
- Suggests process changes and policy updates to address systemic issues
- Prioritizes recommendations based on impact and implementation difficulty
- Includes both short-term fixes and long-term strategic improvements
- Helps organizations develop a comprehensive plan to address bias
- Supports continuous improvement in fair lending practices
